Imagine you're a product developer/manager with some technical knowledge in terms of functional programming. Is there a real difference between an engineer using functional programming level abstractions to specify to a computer what computations to construct and execute vs. a product developer/manager specifying what they want their engineers to be construct? In both cases, the implementation detail is left to the underlying system or engineers executing the functional programming instructions.

If I viewed my team of engineers as executors of functional programming code to build all my constructs, it could look something like this: A land traffic controller system that needs to be created.

var server = createServer

var loginSetup = createLoginSetup

var database = createDatabase

var security = inspectSecurity

var webPage = composeWebPage server loginSetup database

var finishedLtc = createFinishedLtc webPage security

enhancedFinishedLtc = enhance finishedLtc enhancement

fixedFinishedLtc = fix enhancedFinishedLtc fixLogic

One thing that this communicates is how each piece fits into the whole system and what their roles are. It is also clear what is dependent on what. It can be an interesting way to create a roadmap.
