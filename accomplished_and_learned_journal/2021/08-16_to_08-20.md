## Accomplishments:
**Tasks for event modeling diagram generation tool:**
- Implemented split into substrings by char function in InputTextParsing domain
- Finished implementing InputTextParsing domain in event modeling interpreter for Haskell

**Tasks for docopt.hs repo**
- Took over as maintainer for docopt.hs and accepted pull request change that fixed compatibility issue with latest Haskell compiler
- Started to break down the testing infrastructure for docopt.hs and slowly refactor to a better one

## Learned Along the Way:
- I think the issue I've been having with most texts covering algebra programming related topics is that they are not starting with a specifications to illustrate how the algebra and domain development manifests from it. I think adding that one extra context factor will add such great clarity to the process.
- I need to learn more about software spec writing
