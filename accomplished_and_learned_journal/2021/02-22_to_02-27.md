## Accomplishments:

**Tasks for event modeling diagram generation tool:**
- Fill out some of expectations for scenario 1
- Started specifying algebra design
- Specified algebra design until I can start coding the actual implementation
- Implemented models and stub of algebra design for the foundational part of interpreter
- Implement models and stub of algebra design for input parsing layer
- Redesigned the verbiage for play script to allow easier parsing and clear verbiage
- Updated tests with new verbiage

## Learned Along the Way:

**In relation to putting algebra driven design into practice:**
- Filling out expectations for scenario 1 helped illustrate what data types were necessary
- I figured out how to incorporate algebraic datatype concept of records to represent a data encapsulates other data types
- It probably is okay to incorporate error representation along the way
- Can't think of anything else missing once algebra driven design is done
- Having to go back to expand on the algebra design when stubbing out models revealed some needed expression but it was super easy and straightforward, a lot easier than I would expect it to be.
- Learning curve for doing algebra design from start to finish for first time wasn't as challenging as I thought it would be
- Implementing models and stubs in Rust after defining algebraic data types was straightforward, I had to review and update some of the abstract data types but it was easy
- Algebra driven design is helping me avoid subconscious worry about design complexity
- Refactoring is always worth it
