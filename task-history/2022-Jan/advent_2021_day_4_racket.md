**Question**
: Does there exist a way to run all tests in a directory without specifying file name?

**Hypothesis**
: Based on this documentation (https://download.racket-lang.org/releases/6.0.1/doc/raco/test.html) I would expect the answer to be yes because the documentation says that it will by default recursively go through all the possible directories. I will try the command `raco test .` and raco test finding all the .rkt test modules should happen and the results should be reported

**Observation**
: When I tried the command `raco test.` the tests all ran as expected. This greatly enhances the development experience compared to what I thought of before where you have to specify the specific .rkt file whenever calling the `raco test` command and that is a good thing.
