# Go through 8 to be great book and break down what are some things that can be applied to engineering

**Problem**: What are some avenues I can explore to mentally better myself as a software engineer?

**Solution**: The 8 to be great book seems to be a great resource for finding out how to find an edge when it comes to competitive endeavors. The 8 traits that I can apply to engineering are. Passion, work, focus, push, ideas, improve, serve, and persist.

## Passion:
Passion is the starting point. For me with engineering, I am most passionate about automation and engineering that makes my life and tools better. I am also super passionate about automation that work towards a solar punk future that I hope for. It's super important to not get stuck in a trap of learning things for the sake of being in demand or popular because that comes at the cost of genuine passion.

## Work:
Work is the substance. For me with engineering, work is solving problems well and ensuring that your future self and other people can continue to expand on your solutions. Work is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration. In engineering, it is crucial that you ensure work setups and workflows that allows the process to feel enjoyable. In my case, methodologies such as `scientific domain design`, `theory to event modeling`, `working backwards from perfection`, and `scientific notation process` allow me to enjoy the process at which I work. Languages such as Racket, Haskell, and Rust facilitate my thought process and I enjoy reading other people's code written in those languages to get inspiration on how to write my own code and solutions.

When it comes to work, I believe that hard work can trump over talent. For engineering, the confident attitude that even the most talented genius could get lapped by strong work ethic carries me very far.

## Focus:
Focus is tactics. In engineering, focus is identifying what gives you the most result for a given effort. I still need to work on this as I have not identified a niche or an area to focus on in my passion for solar punk future yet. To find something to focus on, I currently should be going wide and dabble in different areas until I find what I want to focus on.

## Push:
Push is overcoming adversity. For me with engineering, it is the the continued motion of moving forward even against a hard problem. To push in software engineering is to strive for higher quality software, to plan well before executing, to research a problem thoroughly. Preventing bad habits of code/system rot or code/system ambiguity requires a lot of push and discipline. Taking the time to encapsulate and truly codify domain expertise requires a lot of push as well.

## Ideas:
Ideas are inspiration. In engineering, great ideas have the power to impact the world or set a new paradigm in thinking. As an engineer, I currently get new ideas by reading other people's code, watching tech talks, brainstorming with friends, and having problems that need an extra hand. When I still can't get new ideas, I borrow an idea to improve upon and see if I succeed or fail. One thing I want to get better at is looking for failed ideas or mistakes people made and see if I can improve them to become successful ideas incase I have ideas that can make them successful.

## Improve:
Improving is evolution and practice. In engineering, since new technologies and ideas are constantly coming out, there is always room to improve upon what we did yesterday. It is also like becoming piano player, nobody becomes a strong software engineer without creating actual programs and getting them to work properly. For me with software engineering, improving is expanding the functional toolset on how to model and solve problems that haven't been solved yet. It also means to solve currently addressed problem even better. The current strength I want to focus on is scientific domain modeling and a weakness that I am well aware of is frontend programming which I have to outsource or strengthen if needed.

## Serve:
Serving is purpose. For me with engineering, I'm still searching for how I can serve people.

## Persist:
Persisting is consistency and endurance. For me with engineering, I'm willing to persist through the length of time it takes to reach mastery and beyond. I don't mind encountering and persisting through industry changes that will make me have to adapt or change my skillset. I don't mind persisting through the challenges of an engineering project that was abandoned and have to take on the reigns.
